# README - Large Language Models (LLM) Workshop Assessment

## Overview
This repository contains my assessment submission and the certificate I earned upon successfully completing the **Large Language Models (LLM) Workshop** offered by NVIDIA's Deep Learning Institute (DLI).

## About the Course
The **LLM Workshop** provides a hands-on introduction to working with large language models, exploring their capabilities, and building AI-driven applications. The workshop covers essential concepts, including:
- Using the HuggingFace model repository and the `transformers` API
- Exploring encoder models for tasks like semantic analysis, embedding, and zero-shot classification
- Working with decoder models for text generation and conversation
- Applying state management and composition techniques to improve the accuracy and coherence of AI-generated text
- Developing AI-driven applications leveraging LLMs for automation and advanced problem-solving

### Workshop Highlights
Participants gained practical experience in building LLM applications using open-source models and frameworks. The final assessment involved implementing a **synthetic prompt pipeline** for image-inspired generation, integrating vision models with text-to-text transformation to enhance the input for diffusion models.

## About My Assessment
For my final assessment, I implemented an **image-inspired generation pipeline** that leverages LLMs to create synthetic prompts for image generation. This involved:

### Key Steps
1. **Image Ingestion:** Extracting and analyzing an image to generate a textual summary.
2. **LLM-Enabled Interface:** Mapping vision model descriptions to structured text prompts for diffusion models.
3. **Synthetic Prompt Generation:** Using an LLM to generate four unique synthetic prompts.
4. **Image Generation Pipeline:** Producing distinct images based on the refined prompts.

### Technologies Used
- **Python** for scripting and automation
- **HuggingFace Transformers** for working with pre-trained LLMs
- **LangChain & LlamaIndex** for structured retrieval and composition
- **PyTorch** for model interactions
- **PIL** for image handling

### Key Learnings & Takeaways
- Learned how to efficiently manage state in LLM-driven applications
- Explored techniques for improving prompt quality and model outputs
- Gained experience in integrating vision models with LLMs
- Optimized pipeline execution using parallel processing and batching
